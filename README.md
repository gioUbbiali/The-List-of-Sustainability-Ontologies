# The List of Sustainability Ontologies

## Description

This repository maintains the List of Sustainability Ontologies.The List of Sustainability Ontologies documents the ontologies and terms explored during the review assessment performed in [Ubbiali *et al.* (2024)](https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/z8uqr), (Annex 1 of this publication).

The List of Sustainability ontologies is a starting basis for developing a catalog of ontological resources addressing sustainability and sustainable development.


## Material

The list of Sustainability Ontologies includes three spreadsheets: 

1) [The list guidelines.](https://github.com/gioUbbiali/The-List-of-Sustainability-Ontologies/tree/main/List%20guidelines)
2) The list of assessed ontologies [(List A)](https://github.com/gioUbbiali/The-List-of-Sustainability-Ontologies/tree/main/List%20A).
3) The list of assessed terms [(List B)](https://github.com/gioUbbiali/The-List-of-Sustainability-Ontologies/tree/main/LIst%20B).

The list guidelines spreadsheet and the "methods" section of [Ubbiali *et al.* (2024)](https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/z8uqr ) detail the methodology followed for constructing these lists.

Spreadsheets are available both in Excel and CSV formats.
